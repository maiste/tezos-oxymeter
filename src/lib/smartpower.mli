type station

(** [create host port] tries to reach the smartpower socket on [host]:[port]
    and creates a permanent connection. In case of error it raises UNIX
    exceptions. It is wrapped into an Lwt monad to handle the asynchrous
    I/O. *)

    success. *)
val delete : station Lwt.t -> unit Lwt.t

(** [observe station] returns a {!type:Report.t} which represents the
     information gathered by the smartpower at one moment. *)
