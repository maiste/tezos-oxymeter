(** [create] builds a report with the information provide.

    Usage: [create ~joule ~volt ~ampere ~power ~watt_hour time]
     - [joule] is the instant energy (default is 0).
     - [volt] represents the voltage (default is 0).
     - [ampere] represents the intensity (default is 0).
     - [power] refers to the power consumption (default is 0).
     - [watt_hour] is the energy per time consumption (default is 0).
     - [time] is a UNIX timestamp. *)

(** [pp ppf report] is used to pretty print the report. *)

(** [json_of_t report] converts a {!t} report into a Json, usable by
    Data_encoding. *)
